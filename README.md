# ImageToLego
- This application takes a small image and converts it to known colors, and calculates what LEGO pieces are needed to build the image.
- The image is converted by going through each pixel, and getting the pixels closest color from a known library of colors. 
- Works best on smaller images.

## How It Works
- Upload an image by clicking the "..." circled in the image below.  The image will then load up onto the left panel circled in blue.  
- When a row from the image on the left panel is clicked, it displays the lego pieces to build that row in the output.
