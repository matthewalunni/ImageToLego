# ImageToLego
This application takes an image and converts it to known colors, and calculates what LEGO pieces are needed to build the image.

## How It Works
- Upload an image by clicking the "..." circled in the image below.  The image will then load up onto the left panel circled in blue.  
- When a row from the image on the left panel is clicked, it displays the lego pieces to build that row in the output.
